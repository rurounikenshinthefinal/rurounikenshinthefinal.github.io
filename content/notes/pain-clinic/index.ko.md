## 배경

The docs module/layout was applied for the `docs` section by default, it makes sense to separate the multiple digital gardens into different sections in most cases, such as docs for multiple projects, guides and notes.

## No steroids

To use the docs layout on sections other than `docs`, what you need to do is to set the `type` to `docs` in front matter.

{{< bs/config-toggle >}}
